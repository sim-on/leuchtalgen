# leuchtalgen
## A fun fluid simulation written in HTML5 canvas + JavaScript.
I wanted to recreate bioluminescent algae that light up whenn stirred. The fluid solver is based on the paper ["Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games" by Jos Stam](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf).
